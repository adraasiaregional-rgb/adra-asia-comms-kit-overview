## Safeguarding and Ethics

Safeguarding is central to the design of the ADRA Asia Comms Kit. The app reinforces responsible storytelling practices, informed consent, and respect for the dignity and safety of all individuals and communities represented.

AI-supported features are designed to assist—not replace—human judgment. All generated content must be reviewed by the user and aligned with ADRA’s global safeguarding standards.
